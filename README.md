## How to use (v1.1)
Skybox Path: Path to a folder with .tex files (textures for the skybox) inside.
Fonts Path: Path to a folder with fonts inside. Usually named SourceSans to replace the default fonts.
Sounds Path: Path to a folder with sounds in it. Everything but volume_slider and ouch (ogg) are mp3. Can be an audio ID
(in this format: audioid,subfolder-optional\...\file.ogg OR .mp3).
Textures Path: Path with (2D) textures. You can replace the default face, cursors, etc.
When replacing cursors put shiftlock (MouseLockedCursor) here, camtoggle (CrossMouseIcon) on \YourFolder\Cursors,
and the others on \YourFolder\Cursors\KeyboardMouse (Note: Only cursors export.) Can be a decal id (in this format:
decalid,subfolder-optional\...\file.png,width-optional,height-optional).

## Notes
~~i swear 1.1 is coming someday ill try to upload it tmrw~~
gonna upload full 1.1 release in like 100 years idk

## Future
so like i'm now using bloxstrap and it automatically does the mods 4 me so 1.1 will probably be the last release
